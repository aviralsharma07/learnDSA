/*
- Recursion: It is a phenomenon when a function calls itself indefinitely until a specified condition is fulfilled.
- Whenever recursion calls are executed, theyâ€™re simultaneously stored in a recursion stack where they wait for the completion of the recursive function.
- A recursive function can only be completed if a base condition is fulfilled and the control returns to the parent function.
